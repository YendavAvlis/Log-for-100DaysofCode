# Log-for-100DaysofCode
This a repository were I am going to be logging all the activities of my #100DaysofCode challenge...

Day 0: 15 November 2022

Preparing my mind for the challenge that comes, and planning all the things to avoid making mistakes or fail...

Thoughts: I am a little bit nervous and anxious, due to the fear of failing before it even starts

Day 1: 16 November 2022

I managed to do my first 2 hours of the challenge. Currently I am following the free course from The Odin Project curriculum, I was studying and practicing how to manipulate the elements in the DOM. I was able to finish the first exercise, actually it was not a big deal.
Thoughts: I am feeling great because I was able to figure out the solution for the exercise. >D
